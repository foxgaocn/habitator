When I have dinner, I will chew each mouthful for more than 10 times, so that I can cut 10 per cent off calorie count

When it's 11pm, I'll go to bed, so that my liver can detox my body better

When I finish my lunch, I'll Breathe deeply for 3 minutes, so that I will be calm and vibrant.

When I get up, I'll drink a cup of water, so that I can expel toxins as quickly as possible

After I get up, I'll have breakfeast, so that I am fueled up and ready for the day.

When it's 10am, I'll eat a fruit, so that my stomach can more easily process all of the nutrients, fibre and the simple sugars contained in the fruit

When it's 3pm, I'll strech my body, so that my body won't get stiff

After I get up, I'll run for a while, so that I can start my day in a good mood and keep fit in a long run



When dinner is ready, I'll say 'thank you' to my wife, so that she feels her hard work was appreciated
When I get back home, I'll hug my wife, so that she feel my love

When I leave home for work, I'll hug my kids and say "I love you", so that they can feel my love
When the kid go to bed, I'll snuggle with him and chat for a while, so that he goes into sleep with emotional satisfaction.
