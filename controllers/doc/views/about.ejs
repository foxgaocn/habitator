            </div>
            <p> Most of us realize the importance of habit. However it is very difficult to make or break a habit. As the best selling author Seth Godin once said: </p>
            <p class='quotation'>"Your audacious life goals are fabulous. We're proud of you for having them. But it's possible that those goals are designed to distract you from the thing that's really frightening you -- the shift in daily habits that would mean a re-invention of how you see yourself."</p>
            <p>A lot of reseraches have been conducted by psychologist and neurologist, and a lot of theories about making habit formed. Among those theories, some of them are proved to be effective and helpful by the practice of a large amount of people:</p>
